# Topic 3: File Handling and Regular Expressions in Testing

## Introduction

In this session, we will cover how to handling files start by covering essential Python fundamentals, including **variables**, **data types**, and **operators**, which are critical for understanding how control structures and functions work in test scripts. We will also ensure all necessary tools are installed and set up.

### What You Will Learn:

- File handling (reading and writing)
- Regular expression

## Task Exercises:

These tasks should be delivered/solved in maximum 1 week (next Friday).

#### File Handling
1. Read the file and remove equal lines (if any).
2. Print out all words with length of n-characters
3. Combine two files into a third file

#### Regular Expressions
1. Define if a string contains the required characters. E.g. if '7865serS3' includes '583' - True; '973' - False
2. Count a number of Upper case letters in the string. E.g. '7865serS3' - 'Number of Capital letters: 1'
3. Define if the string contains at least one Upper case letter followed by Lower case letters. E.g. '75serS3' - False; '75WseTrS3' - True;
